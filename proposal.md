# Zombie Grrrlz Proposal 

## Repository
https://github.com/phebelinn/final-project.git

## Description
My program will be a top-down roleplaying game featuring a zombie player character. 

## Features
- Player controls 
	- Will take WASD or arrow controls to move a character 
	- Flip between images to animate walking 
- Interactive map
	- Player can interact with items depending on player coordinates and keyboard input 
        - Use library to store items & feed to reusable function
- Choice-based story  
	- Game will prompt for user input to determine story outcomes 

## Challenges
- How to take ongoing player input
- How to layer images 
- How to animate text 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, the game will have multiple rooms and characters for the player to explore, interact with, and talk to. They will follow a brief storyline with multiple possible endings. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Minimal outcome would involve an interactive room that allows the player to move and interact with objects. Fixed storyline or puzzle would be present for player to follow.
