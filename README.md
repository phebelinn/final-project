## Project Description 
My project is a visual-novel style game with RPG controls. It follows a disoriented zombie girl who finds herself in a graveyard, talking to skeletons. The controls are WASD for movement and spacebar for dialogue advancement. 

The img folder contains all assets drawn & used in the game. This program challenged me, and I underestimated the scope of my initial plan. I have become much more familiar with pygame and game structure throughout and hope to improve in the future to broaden features and include more areas of user interaction.
